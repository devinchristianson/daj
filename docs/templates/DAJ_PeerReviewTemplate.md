For each of the team members in your group you need to complete the following evaluation. You should
submit all the evaluations in one zip/pdf file on blackboard.
The final mark of the project for each individual student will be calculated as follows:
The average of the peer-reviewed evaluations * The total mark of the group.
Please note that only realistic and fair peer-reviewed evaluations will be taken into consideration. The
instructor has all the rights to decide upon that.
The peer reviews must remain confidential and anonymous. You should not discuss your reviews with the
other students. Try to be constructive and fair.
