## Sprint #4 Review

### Features Implemented

- 

### Issues fixed

- 

### Successes

 - 

###  Problems/Solutions

 - User accounts add a lot of complexity. In order to avoid some of that complexity, we are using Google Sign-on to handle Authentication, meaning PolyChord needs to interface with Google Sign-on, and handle sessions.

### Changes made

 - A Unit + Integration testing framework has been put in place, using Mocha, Karma, and Chai. This wasn't required for any specific use cases, but was necessary to find bugs and keep the code quality good.
 - Progress was made on the backend for the user accounts and Google Sign-on functionality. The database and the database logic still need to be implemented.

### Next Sprint

 - Continue work on the backend for Google Sign-on
