# Future Work

While the core functionality of PolyChord has been implemented, as we near the end of the time period for the development for PolyChord we are still left with work that still needs to be done. Unfortunately, due to the time period initially being quite constrained, and these constraints being further amplified from the current events, there is still a lot that wasn't implemented. To begin, here is a list of all of the remaining user stories.

## Remaining User Stories

## Plan for Future Work
As you can see, there are many remaining user stories. To break this down, we will discuss what the priorities are moving forward, and which user stories they relate to.

-   Accounts
	- We have been working on user accounts, but they have not been finished. Many of the functionalities we want to implement rely on accounts so it is important we get this implemented as soon as possible.
		- 6 - As a registered user I need to be able to save chord progressions so that I can reference them in the future.
		-  41 - As a former user I need to be able to delete my account so that I no longer need to worry about my account.		

-   Implement More Sounds for the Synth
	- We want to prioritize the addition of more sounds to the synth because it is a relatively easy addition and adds a lot to the user experience by allowing for more diverse sounds and for the user to select what they find most pleasing to listen to.
		- 9 - As a multi-faceted musician I need to have multiple instrument samples available to play so that I can hear chords in different timbres/contexts.


-   Chord Training
	- We want to add chord training because it encourages further exploration by showing the user chords that they may not have realized otherwise.
		- 10 - As an amateur musician I need to be able to look at the structure of different chords so that I can learn how to play new chords.
		- 34 - As a musician who is having trouble learning the theory I need to be able to see how I can correctly play a chord I might be playing wrong so that I can improve my knowledge of theory.
    
-   Chord Progression Building
	- We want to implement the chord progression builder because users coming up with chord progressions is a natural consequence of experimenting with chords. By allowing users to build and save chord progressions in the app itself we can provide a more holistic experience. The chord builder also would naturally also include the ability to play back and view these chord progressions.
		- 6 - As a registered user I need to be able to save chord progressions so that I can reference them in the future.
		- 13 - As a musician I need to be able to play a melody over the chords as it plays them back so that I can develop music further from my chord progressions.
    
-   Tutorial
	- While we strive to make PolyChord as intuitive and minimalist as possible, inevitably people will get confused. A simple tutorial would go a long way in ensuring users understand how to use PolyChord and what it is.
		- 46 - As a user confused about how to use PolyChord I need to have a help menu so that I can better understand the app.

-   Lessons and Training Exercises
	- Alongside the chord training which is very free form, we also want to add some more structured lessons and exercises to provide users with a solid foundation to build off of with their own experimentation.
		- 3 - As an amateur musician I need to be able to look at common chord progressions so that I can experiment with making music.
		- 24 - As an amateur musician I need to have sight reading exercises so that I can improve as a musician.
		- 26 - As a person trying to practice perfect pitch I need to have an option to listen to a chord and try to identify it so that I can improve my musical hearing.
		- 37 - As a musician wanting to learn basic music theory I need tutorials in the app on concepts of music theory so that I can improve as a musician
		- 39 - As a musician who wants to see how I am progressing I need to see my accuracy in recognizing theory over time so that I can see how well I am improving my knowledge of theory.

-   General Improvements
	- Here are some user stories that are improvements we find important and want to prioritize, but didn't really fall into a broader category.
		- 14 - As a musician I need an option for a metronome so that I can practice playing in time.
		- 15 - As a musician I need an option to play with different drum patterns so that I can hear the chords in context with a rhythm.
		- 43 - As a registered PolyChord user I need to have independent volume control so that I can have more control over my experience.
