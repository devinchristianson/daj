# Focus Group
We conducted a focus group on March 15th for our app with four participants. The focus group was done online over Skype and was not recorded as not all participants were okay with being recorded. The script was created as an outline of how we wanted the focus group to be structured, and while detailed, isn't to be followed word by word. The results of the feedback from the focus group is documented in the results section of this paper.

## Script
Hello and welcome to the focus group for PolyChord, thank you for taking the time to come. Before we begin I just want to confirm that everyone has signed the permission form.

*display current building PolyChord*

Alright so, we are creating a webapp called PolyChord for our software engineering course. The core functionality of PolyChord is that it is an online synthesizer that recognizes chords as you play them.

*short demonstration*

Right now, for input options there is currently only keyboard and mouse support, but we plan to add support for touchscreens and midi controllers as well. Along with this would also include the ability to extend the digital keyboard to include more keys.

Other functionality we plan to add is more and better soundfonts for the keyboard. Octave switching.The ability to save and playback chords. As well as the ability to select chords and have them played for you, sort of the inverse functionality.

With the introduction complete, I'd like to direct you to this link (polychord.dawsinb.repl.co) where you can get a feel for the application yourself.

*allow focus group to explore the app for a bit*

...

Now I'd like to enter into the questions and answers section, so if anyone has any comments, suggestions or questions please say so.

*q&a section, focus on (Tutorials, Chords, UI, General Feedback)*

... 


Alright I think that wraps it up for our focus group section. I would like to thank you all again for taking the time to come and do this. If you want to follow the project it is public on github and the repo is called "daj" there.
