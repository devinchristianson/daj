### midi.city 

​	midi.city is a online synthesizer with many different sound options, drum kits, and WebMIDI integration, allowing the user to use either their keyboard or a MIDI instrument. This application is similar to our concept in that it is a web app that allows piano-style input through multiple channels, and provides some good basic synth options. Our concept improves upon this by adding chord identification as you play, helping musicians who tend to learn by experimentation see what chords they've found by ear. Our concept will then further their learning and experimentation by suggesting chord progressions based on the chords they are playing.

### ChordChord

​	ChordChord is an online chord generation tool: it can play chords (with piano fingerings), as well as play chord progressions. ChordChord also takes input from the keyboard, but it does not identify the chords played through that input. This application is similar to our concept in that it shows chord fingerings on a piano, and allows the user to generate chord progression based on their "feel", but does not give the "proper" names of the chord progression. Our concept improves on this by identifying chords as you play by default, with the option to generate chords and chord progression, as well as relating the "feeling" of the chord with it's "proper" name. These improvements allow the user experience to be more free flowing while also more educational, encouraging more broad use than simply a point of reference: it is designed to be a tool for learning.
