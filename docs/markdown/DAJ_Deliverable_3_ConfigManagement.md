# Configuration Management Plan

## 1. Introduction

tl;dr Describe the plan’s purpose, scope of application, key terms, and 
references.

- Overview description of the software project
- Identification of the software configuration items (CIs) to which SCM will be applied.
- Identification of other software to be included as part of the plan (e.g., support or test software).
- Relationship of SCM to the hardware or system configuration management activities for the project.
- The degree of formality, depth of control, and portion of the software life cycle for applying SCM on this project.
- Limitations, such as time constraints, that apply to the plan.
- Assumptions that might have an impact on the cost, schedule, or ability to perform defined SCM activities (e.g., assumptions of the degree of customer participation in SCM activities or the availability of automated aids). 

## 2. Management

### 2.1 Organization

Organizational context (technical and managerial) within which the configuration management activities are implemented. 

### 2.2 Responsibilities

List name or job title of people how perform activities.

For each board, list:

- Purpose and objectives
- Membership and affiliations
- Period of effectivity
- Scope of authority
- Operational procedures
### 2.3 Applicable policies, directives and procedures

External constraints placed on the SCMP

## 3. Activities

(What?) – Identify all activities to be performed in applying to the project.

### 3.1 Configuration identification

- Identify configuration items (events, items, procedures)
- Name configuration items (unique identifiers)
- Acquiring configuration items (physical procedures)

### 3.2. Configuration control

- Requesting changes
- Evaluating changes
- Approving or disapproving changes
- Implementing changes

### 3.3. Configuration status accounting

- Metrics to be tracked and reported and type of report.
- Storage and access control of status data.

### 3.4. Configuration evaluation and reviews

- At minimum an audit on a CI prior to its release.

- Defines objective, schedule, procedures, participants, approval criteria etc.

### 3.5 Interface control

- Coordination of changes to CIs with changes to interfacing items outside of the scope of the Plan.
### 3.6. Subcontractor/vendor control
Incorporation of items developed outside the project environment into the project CIs.
### 3.7 Release Management and Delivery
Description of the formal control of build, release and delivery of software products.
## 4 Schedules

- Sequence and coordination of SCM activities.
- Relationship of key SCM activities to project milestones or events, such as:
  - Establishment of configuration baseline
  - Implementation of change control procedures
  - Start and completion dates for a configuration audit
- Schedule either as absolute dates, relative to SCM or project milestones or as sequence of events.
- Graphical representations can be used here.

## Resources

- Identifies environment, infrastructure, software tools, techniques, equipment, personnel, and training.
- Key factors for infrastructure:
  - Functionality, performance, safety, security, availability, space requirements, equipment, costs, and time constraints.
- Identify which tools are used in which activity

## Plan Maintenance

- Who is responsible for monitoring the plan?
- How frequently updates are to be performed?
- How changes to the Plan are to be evaluated and approved?
- How changes to the Plan are to be made and communicated?
- Also includes history of changes made to the plan.
