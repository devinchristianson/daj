### Features Implemented

 - Key Sustain
 - Minor CSS Improvements


### Issues fixed

 - Octave switching causing keys to be indefinitely held
 - General code refactoring (Rewrote octave switching, cleaned up mouse event logic, fixed data elements of key objects, many other minor fixes)

### Successes

 - Key sustain implementation went well and works great. It definitely helps side step the unavoidable key rollover issue.
 - Octave switching works much cleaner now and is less buggy.
 - General code refactoring makes the code base much more manageable moving forward.

###  Problems/Solutions

 - The widespread power and internet outages made working on code difficult.
 - Code refactoring took longer than expected, but did turn out really well in the end.
 - Nonetheless, these previous two issues limited the amount of new features that were able to be implemented.


### Changes made

 - The code refactoring helped make the general logic of the project more cohesive. As well, the code now better reflects the architecture and design patterns we laid out this deliverable.
 - Apart from structural changes the vision of the project remains the same.

### Next Sprint

 - We need to finish adding the features we didn't get around to doing this sprint. The biggest two being touch support, and google sign on functionality.
 - Touch support has been researched and we have an idea of how to implemented, but has yet to be started.
 - Google sign on functionality is partially complete, but still needs to be fully implemented.

### Scrum Review

 - What went well: Scrum meetings went well and were very productive. The delegation of tasks was clear despite the issues with power and internet outages everyone. The transition to doing scrum meetings remotely has been very clean for us.
 - What needs improvement: Power and internet outages made the scheduling of meetings difficult, but the ones we did have we definitely made the most of. We should continue to strive to keep our meetings as efficient as possible with everything being so turbulent right now.
